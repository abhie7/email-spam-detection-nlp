breaking , and we all  keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology . we also find  out , through our own experience , that at this age of information explosion ,  it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep  abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department , let  alone in the industry . it is also our personal experience that many a  project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of  this group .  as a remedy , we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag  lunch group meeting , once every two weeks on friday , for about 50 minutes .  it is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new  technology and development , as well as with each other \\x01 , s work , so that we do  not have to reinvent the wheels .  we envision the following : in this meeting ( or seminar ) , each one of us will  take turns to make presentations to the group . the topics could range from  theoretical consideration to practical implementation , be it option pricing ,  process modelling , insurance issue , or monte carlo simulation , or anything  one finds fascinating . the presentation material could be papers you have  been reading recently , projects you are working on , some problem that  bothers you , or an idea that is fascinating . you choose your own  presentation style . it could be  everything - you - always - wanted - to - know - but - were - afraid - to - ask , hand waving  style , or it can involve nitty - gritty , detailed derivations , anyway a style  that suits you and the topic . or it can simply be a dry - run for your  presentation at the next risk conference . zimin and alex will take upon the  responsibility of organizing the seminar .  we hope the seminar will be up and running in two - three weeks . for that  purpose your support will be greatly appreciated . please let either zimin or  alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and  provide a tentative schedule . surely the rest of the group will be happy to  hear your presentation .  we encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting , either to give a  talk or just sit in .  zimin lu  alex huang  message two  dear everyone ,  it looks like the proposed bblop has great support and is to have a great  start . vince , grant , , amitava , kevin , clayton and chonawee have promised  to give presentations to us . vince will kindly deliver the inaugural  presentation next friday ( march 31 ) on new methodology for option pricing  ( precise title  tba ) . bblop will start at 12 noon and last about 45 to 50 minutes . let ' s  make this a new enron tradition !  best regards .  zimin ,  alex\",\n \"Subject: energycast  dear vince ,  i hope your trip to australia was successful . it ' s one of my favorite places  to go .  i ' ve copied you on the email to mike initiating enron ' s trial service to  energycast . thanks for helping to set this up .  would you ask the authorities in enron to refresh my access to enrononline ?  my guest user id as ena 61296 and my guest password was tr 84 byl 3 . they no  longer work , probably because i haven ' t visited the site in months as we  were in full development mode on energycast .  vince , you will note in our website references to forward prices of power in  nepool , nypp , and pjm . we use reuters as a reference -

( see  sidebar )  pat hanley , overnite transportation \\' s senior vice president and chief  financial officer , said freight figures were flat in february year over year  but rose slightly in march . overnite is the exception to the ltl industry  with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year .  \" january was pretty good to us , but february was flat . it \\' s coming back in  march . we \\' re probably up in low single digits , 3 to 4 percent . we \\' re picking  back up . the economy has hurt us . if you had asked us at the start of the  year , we \\' d have said we \\' d be up double - digits , \" hanley said .  the national economic picture is \" a big concern , \" hanley said . \" we \\' re not  seeing pressure on prices , at least not so far . we \\' re seeing customers ship  10 pallets a day instead of 20 . the shipment size is coming down . certainly  we \\' re concerned . we \\' ll do o . k . , but not as great as we \\' d like . \"  forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever  stars align in federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan \\' s world . the  genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking , which  is always a first - in , first - out industry in any economic slowdown .  to hear trucking industry leaders tell it , get comfortable with beans and  franks for dinner . it \\' s going to be awhile before it \\' s filet mignon time  again .  shippers see what \\' s happening as well but say it \\' s still too early in the  year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks .  \" all the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business  levels - - definitely slower than early last year , \" said bill huie , assistant  vice president of corporate transportation for nch corp . , irving , texas .  \" with a couple of exceptions , carriers we talk with have no plans for  expansion in the next few months . we are getting feelers about some possible  lane adjustments to boost revenue . but generally it appears a little early in  the economic downturn for much price movement . \"  the national ltl carriers are seeing the same things . \" our business is down  pretty substantially for the first quarter , \" said roger dick , spokesman for  yellow corp . , parent of yellow freight system and two large regional ltl  carriers , jevic transportation , delanco , n . j . , and saia motor freight ,  duluth , ga .  usfreightways corp . , citing what it called the nation \\' s \" serious economic  slowdown , \" said it expects first - quarter earnings to fall \" very substantially  below \" current wall street consensus .  extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating  environment , usf chairman , president and ceo samuel k . skinner added .  \" traditionally , the first quarter builds momentum slowly , with march being  the strongest month of the period , \" skinner said in a statement . \" this year ,  the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in january  and february , softening even the normal modest expectations for those two  months . \"  it \\' s not just the ltl industry that \\' s hurting . the morgan stanley dean witter  truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand - supply  relationship since analyst james j . valentine began tracking the data in  april 1994 . two events can cause weakness in the index , according to  valentine . they are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak  freight demand .  \" so far in 2001 , we have seen the confluence of both factors , but the  fall - off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply , \" valentine wrote  in his most recent \" trucking snapshot \" for early march .  year - to - date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over  year , according to valentine \\' s index , while supply is up only 7 percent . that  would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was  \" masked by the strong economy , \" valentine says .  in a more ominous note , valentine believes overcapacity will continue to  plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years . only a  reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand - supply back in balance  for the truckload sector in the near term , valentine predicts .  the overproduction of new class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last  year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at  manufacturers , wholesalers and other retailers . used trucks have lost on  average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months .  anecdotally , one used truck dealer , music city truck & equipment , in  lavergne , tenn . , is holding a \" two - for - one \" sale on three - to five - year - old  class 8 freightliners . you can buy two for around $ 30 , 000 , less than a brand  new chevy suburban suv .  what that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 class 8 truck for $ 70 , 000 and  depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the  books this year at $ 35 , 000 . but assuming it has lost 30 percent of that  value , it may only be worth $ 24 , 500 in actuality . for a carrier with a  100 - truck fleet , that equates to a loss of more than $ 1 million on assets .  the glut may last for a while , according to valentine \\' s analysis . assuming a  three - year trade - in cycle , most of the class 8 tractors in the truckload  sector are just now rolling over to the used - truck market . that means that  overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year .  that will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business , as  did nearly 1 , 900 carriers last year that either closed or declared  bankruptcy .  \" we can see from indexes , surveys and other information available to us that  it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in march and freight  demands will continue to be soft throughout the month . based on all of these  factors , we expect usfreightways \\' profits for the first quarter to be very  substantially less than published analysts \\' forecasts , \" skinner said .  in addition , severe weather conditions including an earthquake in seattle ,  rainstorms in california and blizzards in the northeast have added cost and  decreased efficiencies , skinner added .  expectations at each of usf \\' s operating companies have been affected , some  more than others . the ltl , logistics , reverse logistics and  freight - forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a  similar period last year , skinner said .  further job cuts at usf worldwide , its freight forwarder , would be in the  offing as cost controls at the unit would be \" accelerated \" in the wake of the  softening economy , skinner said . late last year , skinner said the rebuilding  process at usf worldwide would be a two - year process . but the worsening  economy has made that rebuilding job harder , he said .  \" we are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is , in fact , further  impeding progress in this area , \" skinner said . \" during the fourth quarter of  2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001 , the company has taken  steps to increase cost efficiencies . among these actions are a substantial  cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force .  these cost - control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance  the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions . \"  in the 2000 first quarter , usf posted $ 22 . 3 million net income , a 27 percent  rise from the $ 17 . 5 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter . at the time ,  that was usf \\' s 15 th straight quarter - over - quarter earnings increase . it came  on $ 608 . 2 million revenue , an 18 . 5 percent rise in from the $ 513 . 2 million  revenue in the 1999 first quarter . analysts had been estimating usf to earn  about $ 3 . 50 a share earnings for 2001 , compared with actual $ 3 . 61 earnings  per share for all of last year . in the fourth quarter last year , usf earned  $ 23 . 7 million , or 91 cents a share .  trucking in a snapshot  market what \\' s going on  msdw [ * ] truckload remains in record - low territory , indicating  freight index the worst demand - supply relationship since msdw  began tracking the date in april 1994 .  diesel prices diesel prices in the first quarter of 2001  have come down 6 % sequentially from 4 qo 0 . however ,  the average price for the quarter remains 6 %  above that of lqo 0 .  wti oil opec recently agreed to reduce supply by 5 % and  has stated a price objective of $ 25 per barrel .  capacity retail sales of class 8 tractors ( new trucks  entering the market ) came down in january , but  inventory ( trucks that will enter the market at some  point ) to sales ratio hit a new high of 3 . 4 months  gdp 4 qo 0 gdp increased 1 . 1 % and economists see u . s .  recession in 2001 with + 0 . 5 % and - 1 . 4 % gdp forecast  for lqol and 2 qol , respectively .  retail sales retail sales rose 0 . 7 % in january . while this  was better than forecast , the upside was likely  the result of excessive clearance sales after a  disappointing holiday season .  consumer the conference board \\' s measure of consumer  confidence confidence fell again ( nine points ) in february  after registering the largest one - month decline  in 10 years in january ( 14 points ) .  napm the february napm rose slightly to 41 . 9 .  however , it still indicates a contracting  manufacturing sector .  leading the index of leading economic indicators  economic rose 0 . 8 % in january , while  indicator msdw had forecast a 0 . 6 % increase . this  represents the first rise in four months .  stock after a recent pullback , trucking stocks remain  perfonnance up year - to - date with tl stocks up 5 % , regional  ltl stocks up 9 % and national ltl stocks up 13 % .  investor for the week ended february 28 , mutual fund  outflows totaled $ 309 million , compared with  inflows of $ 2 billion in the prior week .  market implications  msdw [ * ] truckload negative for all tl carriers .  freight index  diesel prices the downward trend is positive for all  carriers , especially tl carriers , which have  greater exposure to fuel than ltl carriers .  wti oil negative for all carriers , as $ 25 per  barrel is still 25 % higher than the $ 20 per  barrel average since 1990 .  capacity negative for tl carriers , not a major  concern for ltl carriers , which measure  capacity by the number of terminals .  gdp negative for all carriers .  retail sales negative for both ti and ltl carriers .  consumer negative for all carriers  confidence  napm negative for all carriers .  leading positive for all carriers .  economic  indicator  stock positive , however , stocks could pull  perfonnance back further in the short term as  fundamentals catch up .  investor negative .  source : morgan stanley dean witter research',\n 'Subject: hello all  just wanted to share the list of \" one -

we look forward to  establishing a solid working relationship with him going forward .  find below a summary of version _ 1 a for initial rough calculation of mg  metal \\' s var .  also anjam , kirstee ( from london side ) and cantekin , grant , vince and myself  ( houston side ) have been working for last 2 days on the spreadsheet var  model .  the current status of this effort and a plan for future progress is  summarized in the enclosed document :  v @ r methodology for mg metals positions  version _ 1 a  introduction  this document describes the initial rough model for calculations  value - at - risk for mg metals . this model will be implemented in a spreadsheet ,  which will serve as a prototype for the risktrac implementation .  risk factors  the following positions represent most of mg metal \\x01 , s risk and will be covered  by version _ 1 a :  - base metals \\x01 , positions including :  - aluminium ;  - copper ;  - gold ;  - lead ;  - nickel ;  - silver ;  - tin ;  - zinc ;  risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating forward  prices for each metal .  - copper concentrate ;  risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating tc charges .  - cocoa beans ;  risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating forward  prices for cocoa beans .  therefore these 10 curves will drive the risk : price curves for aluminium ,  copper , gold , lead , nickel , silver , tin , zinc and cocoa beans plus tc curve  for copper concentrate .  assumptions and simplifications :  - for each metal we are going to use a single price curve or all types of  products ( physical , financial , lme traded , comex traded , scrap , alloy , stock ,  etc . ) ;  - delta , gamma approach for risk on options \\x01 , positions ;  components required to implement v @ r model :  - current forward prices available from mercur ;  - current implied volatilities available through reuters ;  - current positions from mercur ;  - history of prices required to calculate factor loadings and correlations  across commodities ;  methodology  version _ 1 a will be based on risk matrix approach . we will calculate principal  components for each metal and cocoa beans to take in account the correlations  along the term structure . we will also calculate the correlations across  commodities based on prompt month prices history for last 3 months .  portfolio hierarchy  each position will be assigned to one of the following portfolios under the  whole portfolio agg -

apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account . while the total amount involved is eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) only . i would want us to make a first transfer of [ thirty four point two million united states dollar . u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest . i am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local account , without valid international foreign \" agreement \" , but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international credentials : passport or drivers license and foreign account because this sum is in u . s . dollars and the former owner of the account mr . eshed . b . willey is a foreigner too , thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account . however , knowing all this , we will reach a binding agreement in this regards .  as a matter of urgency , i will inform you the next step to take , while you send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit . i want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe . before we fly to your country for withdrawal , sharing and investments , i need your full co - operation to make this business a success , because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you , upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business . i need your strong assurance that you will never let me down . with my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner \\' s reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing . and to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which i will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account . i will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately i hear from you that you are ready to act as directed . to prove the authenticity of the business i will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries , foreign exchange departments , embassy and board of internal revenue services . at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 35 % of the total amount , 60 % will be for me , while 5 % will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process .  i look forward to your earliest reply through my email address .  respectfully  mr . edward moko .',\n 'Subject: the stickiest faces ever ! ! ! !  shoot your wad all over her face .  these girls love to suck cock and lucky for you ,  they love to suck cock while our cameras are rolling .  \" we have the nastiest cum sucking sluts  available anywhere ! \"  click here  you must be at least 18 to enter !  to be removed from our \" in house \" mailing list click here  and you will automatically be removed from future mailings .  you have received this email by either requesting more information  on one of our sites or someone may have used your email address .  if you received this email in error , please accept our apologies .

tech acquisitions at insead on saturday  alongside participants from cisco , eads , razorfish and cable + wireless , and  academics from insead and wharton . the basic premise was to discuss and get  feedback from practitioners about the research project , and a phd study which  is currently underway at wharton . the discussions were very interesting -  especially as this was my first exposure to this area .  examples of the discussions raised include  why firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them in - house  what degree of post - acquisition integration was optimal  difficulties of us firms acquiring euro / asian high - tech companies  how to value small high - tech firms  how to quantify the success / failure of an acquisition  my feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to  enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give  us first - hand access to the results . plus it would enable us to learn from  the mistakes of others , through meeting practitioners at such workshops and  having greater access to the case studies . i guess it could also aid our  realignment within the high -

tem john burton . burton has just announced a  special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of  price manipulation , and the state auditor is also planning an investigation .  davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being  picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later .  qf ' s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy  sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience  and force bankruptcy on the utilities . sb 47 x may have been california ' s  qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing  against pg & e , socal ed , and sdg & e . the bill designed to cut the qf ' s costs  and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state ' s  senate . sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further  investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates .  out with hebert , in with wood  the bush administration favors replacing hebert , jr . with texas puc head pat  wood . there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican  leader trent lott , who favors hebert , and president bush , who wants wood .  the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a  fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states  in 2004 . in effort to tone down the recent press reports , hebert has made  several token concessions to california , including $ 69 million worth of power  refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and  power plant installation .  it ' s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal  that davis could complete but with a list of conditions . some conditions  might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well  as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in  the west next year . the bush administration is opposed to price caps and  believes in free market solutions . the administration is also considering  whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally -

up to $ 100 per month  home leave - two economy trips per year is standard  transportation to / from assignment - economy class  transportation in houston - we normally give this - up to $ 40 per day for  rental car in addition to the person \\' s car allowance as they normally do not  require a car in the uk and take the car allowance as a cash benefit whereas  they will require a car in houston .  shipment of goods - 500 lbs air  tax assistance  disturbance allowance - normally pay approx $ 1000  so , in terms of costs if you just compare a local us salary of manager on  $ 100 k to a local uk manager on o 68 k the us total cost is approx $ 120 k . the uk  cost is approx $ 230 k . then if you add the above costs to the assignment , you  will see an even greater increase in cost compared with the local peers , ie  approx $ 280 k compared with $ 120 k . we do have the ability to change the above  in any way as there is no set policy ; however , anjam has already brought up  other people \\' s assignments and i have a feeling he will do his best to find  out what everyone else is receiving . if we make clear , though , that we are  keeping on uk payroll but not providing any assignment type allowances just  in order for him to maintain his pension contributions for the year and at  which point a decision will need to be made ( returns or moves to local us ) ,  then we may be able keep more consistency with your group while maintaining  more reasonable costs . not sure how you want to play this , though .  even if he does go on assignment rather than transfer locally , there is still  the issue of whether or not a suitable job will be here at the end of the 12  months . we will always do our best to find suitable postions but we cannot  guarantee it . if he transfers to a local us contract , enron europe \\' s  responsibility of finding suitable employment is pretty much nil .  i hope this has made things clearer rather than more complicated . i honestly  feel that ajnam will absolutely not take this position if it is not on an  assignment basis . he made it pretty clear that unless he could stay on uk  payroll for 12 months , he would not transfer .  call me if you would like to discuss .  tara -

i am 100 % responsible for the delay and obstructions because of their  breach of contract . if you doubt what i have just told you , pay any amount  they will ask you to pay now , after a short time they will come up with  another reason to pay again and it goes on and on . now if you want us to work  together , these are my conditions .  i . i will have 50 % of the money because it is only the two of us left fornow .  ii . you will assist my son to open an account in your country or any other  place of my choice where i will pay in my own share .  iii as you have seen , it will be useless and mere waste of money if you  continue with any other person , so we will conclude the transaction with  utmost secrecy with the above telephone and fax number .  if these conditions are acceptable to you , contact me as soon as possible to  let us finalize so that i will send to you our official ktt wire transfer form  to complete and i will release the money to your account . but if you are not  interested , i advice you to forget the fund as it will be transferred into our  consolidated national reserve .  best regards .  mallam yusuf  director , wire transfer / telex dept .

 03 / 15 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : full circle : asps the new  big blue ?  by mike jude and nancy meachim  the terms \\x01 & asp \\x01 8 and \\x01 & ibm \\x01 8 may have more in common than being three -  letter acronyms .  remember big blue of the early \\x01 + 60 s ? the vision , then , was centralized  computing . mainframe computers hosted complex , expensive applications  that end users accessed via dumb terminals . it infrastructure ,  especially memory , was expensive and needed to be controlled . with  computing resources centralized , ibm reasoned , they were easier to  maintain .  of course , ibm got it wrong , in that computers became a cheap commodity .  and users weren \\x01 , t happy simply using dumb terminals . they wanted a  bigger share in all that technology offered . so , as memory prices fell ,  so did the idea of central control . dumb terminals were transformed into  intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data . the  glass house populated by white - smocked technicians went out of fashion .  looking back on those times , many of us would shake our heads and wonder  how ibm could have been so wrong . but maybe big blue wasn \\x01 , t so far off .  thanks to the advent of application service providers , centralized  computing is making a comeback . asps offer centralized application  management .  the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server  advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning  software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy . but  asps now host all kinds of applications , including small , multilicensed  programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand . but , the  principle remains the same : central control makes support much more  efficient and usually cheaper . how about that , ibm ?  to be fair , the dynamics of an asp are very different from old  centralized mainframe operations . an asp doesn \\x01 , t just host and support  an application for general distribution over an in - house proprietary  network . unlike the ibm vision , an asp is very dependent on network  service . it is also very sensitive to service levels . in the \\x01 + 60 s , if  the mainframe let you down , you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an  hour or so , and your only recourse was that white - smocked fellow .  nowadays , users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a  minute . and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation . the  world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old \\x01 + 60 s shop .  however , if one could magically transport a computer user from the \\x01 + 60 s  to the wonderful new 2000 s , would it seem all that different to him ? in  an ideal asp world , a la scott mcnealy \\x01 , s vision , users would sit down  at a semidumb terminal , download the application du jour , and start  working . what did the \\x01 + 60 s user do ?

keeping .  because of our present status ( political refugees ) , my mother and i are sriously looking forward to having an overseas partner that will assist us with the convenient and legal transfer of the funds out of south africa .  if my proposition is considered , for assisting us to transfer this money to your country , we will offer you 20 % of the total fund , and 5 % of the total will be set aside to cover any expenses incurred during this transaction , 75 % will be for my family to invest . in your country under your supervision .  for detailed information , you can contact me direct .  i would appreciate confidentiality and honesty in our correspondence . your immediate response will be highly wecomed .  best regards ,  mr . newton gwarada',\n 'Subject: re : tony hamilton  chris ,  e hired tony to support global markets but jeff shankman decided that , given  highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the  research group , with a dotted line to mike roberts who is running our weather  group .  given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit gm , it makes sense  for research to charge his expenses  to global markets . we can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to  different sub -

hedging argument leads to the black - scholes pde .  this is true for any arbitrary functions mu and sigma , and so includes gbm ,  mean reversion , and others .  there is no problem with this , because in the risk - neutral world , which is  what you enter if you can hedge ,  the drift of the \" actual \" process is irrelevant .  i believe your concern is that you would like to see a different option price  for mean reversion process . this can only happen if the asset is not  hedgeable , and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the  option pricing . if you assume that the underlying is a non - traded factor ,  then the pde will have to reflect the market price of risk , and the drift of  the actual process is then reflected in the pde .  vasant  zimin lu  10 / 17 / 2000 05 : 20 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vasant  shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , pinnamaneni krishnarao / hou / ect @ ect , alex  huang / corp / enron @ enron , kevin kindall / corp / enron @ enron , tanya  tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : option pricing challenge  dear all ,  i have a fundamental question back in my mind since 95 . hope you can give  me a convincing answer .  zimin  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  in deriving bs differential equation , we assume the underlying follows gbm  ds = mu * s * dt + sigma * s * dz  where mu is the drift , sigma is the volatility , both can be a function of s .  then we use delta hedging argument , we obtain the bs differential equation  for the option price , regardless  of mu .  with the bs pde and boundary condition , we can derive bs formula . fine . no  problem .  question comes here . suppose the underlying is traded security and follows ,  say , mean - reverting process  ds = beta ( alpha - s ) dt + sigma * s * dz  apparantly , this sde leads to a different probability distribution . however ,  using the delta hedging argument ,  we still get the same bs differential equation , with the same boumdary  condition , we get the same bs formula .  not fair !  from another angle , i can derive the distribution from the bs pde for the  underlying , which is the lognormal distribution .  my thinking is : can i drive the distribution for any sde from the option pde  ? the answer should be yes , but got to be  from a different pde rather than bs pde . then what we do about the  delta - hedging argument ?  thanks .',\n 'Subject: re : dinner  julie ,  thanks for the invitation .  tuesday would work better for me .  i came back from california this morning and i am quite exhausted .  what is the number at which i can reach you ?  vince  \" julie \" on 02 / 26 / 2001 11 : 00 : 46 am  please respond to \" julie \"  to : \" vincejkaminski \"  cc :  subject : dinner  would you like to get together for dinner with us tonight ( monday ) or  tomorrow night ?  ?  julie',\n \"Subject: course invoice  vince ,  ?  hi , hope you are well .  ?  i ' m just dropping a note regarding invoice 215 which was for 5 people  attending the energy and weather course . ? our records show that it hasn ' t  been paid , which is good . ? we will re -

cabinet approval for power trading  team : today union cabinet has approved the proposal of ministry of industry  to allow foreign equity participation in power trading . this was conveyed by  secretary ( power ) during his meeting with wade . in normal course , the  proposal was slated to be coming up for cabinet in next few weeks . keeping in  view the developments of dpc invoking state guarantee , perhaps cabinet has  hurried it up .  the exact proposal approved was - \" to allow foreign equity participation  through automatic route upto 100 % for trading in power sector , subject to  prevailing laws . \"  irrespective of urgency of this approval to us , the best thing is that we are  getting the approval without draft electricity bill , 2001 being finalised . as  most of you are aware , initially the proposal was stalled at fipb level  pending finalisation of electricity bill . then it has gone to group of  ministers who had taken a positive approach and now the cabinet has cleared  it .  now fipb either issue an approval to enron llc or advise us to avail  automatic route . we will have one of it , culminating great team work .  seethayya',\n 'Subject: year end 2000 performance feedback  note : you will receive this message each time you are selected as a reviewer .  you have been selected to participate in the year end 2000 performance  management process by providing meaningful feedback on specific employee ( s ) .  your feedback plays an important role in the process , and your participation  is critical to the success of enron \\' s performance management goals .  to complete requests for feedback , access pep at http : / / pep . corp . enron . com  and select perform review under performance review services . you may begin  providing feedback immediately and are requested to have all feedback forms  completed by friday , november 17 , 2000 .  if you have any questions regarding pep or your responsibility in the  process , please contact the pep help desk at :  houston : 1 . 713 . 853 . 4777 , option 4  london : 44 . 207 . 783 . 4040 , option 4  email : perfmgmt @ enron . com  thank you for your participation in this important process .  the following is a cumulative list of employee feedback requests with a  status of \" open . \" once you have submitted or declined an employee \\' s request  for feedback , their name will no longer appear on this list .  review group : enron  feedback due date : nov 17 , 2000  employee name supervisor name date selected  -

term  power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the  bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of  contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very  difficult .  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would \" eat \" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general  fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8  billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this  concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor \\' s plan for handling the crisis , including the  details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward .  currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab  31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill  passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of  republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen ,  currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen \\' s language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be  likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature ,  republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated  that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued .  other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the  republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally ,  lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .  key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b  lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b  lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b  bear stearns $ 625 m  tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt  projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 %  tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 %  current projected  blended ir : 5 . 38 %  maturity date : august 29 , 2001  for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510  bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the  california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion  authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these  authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the  governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb  6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for  the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this  idea earlier in the crisis .  socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the  first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the  governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is  august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according  to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has  signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis  and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash .  the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond  issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan )  stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers ,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the  state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and  passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for  bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the dwr proportionately from rate payments .',\n 'Subject: aiesec  vince ,  my name is shelly jones , i am the analyst recruiting manager for the  associate / analyst program . christy young passed on information from the  university of houston aiesec program . due to the restructuring of the  associate / analyst program and the new policies regarding the interview  process , compensation , offers , etc . , we will not be participating in the  aiesec program this year . due to your past interest in the program , i have  forwarded the literature on to you , via inter -

mail category : cera insight  cera knowledge area : european power  despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among european transmission  system operators , regulators , and the european commission in florence ,  auctions of international transmission capacity ( itc ) in france , the united  kingdom , denmark , belgium , italy , austria , switzerland , slovenia , and the  netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the  single european marketplace .  however , the patchwork auctioning of access to itc leaves important issues  unresolved . the most significant of these include the potential for gaming ,  third - party transit , and the allocation of auction proceeds . as they stand ,  these issues , cera believes , are likely to lead to action at the european  level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme .  nevertheless , current plans to open most of europe \\' s itc represent a  watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and  determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in 2001 .  international auctions are opening markets  a major portion of international transmission capacity on the continent will  be allocated by auction in 2001 ( see table 1 ) . in cera \\' s view auctions for  itc are likely to have the greatest impact during 2001 in the following areas :  * increasing market transparency . the posting of available transmission  capacity on yearly , monthly , and daily bases will facilitate the market \\' s  efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity . for the first time ,  signals for new transmission investment , power flows , and transmission asset  valuation will come from the market .  * increasing cross - border trade . although auctions may not reduce uncertainty  in the marketplace initially , the effect of heightened transparency in access  rules and prices will soon work to increase trade . secondary markets for  interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power  products and work to increase the overall level of trade . ?  * increasing price correlation . auctions will replace nonmarket - based  allocation methods such as long - term capacity reservation . the dynamic  character of shorter - term auctions , combined with an expected secondary  market for capacity , should bring access to international capacity in line  with the needs of the market . in this way the market will be able to adjust  more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate  pricing points .  * increasing competition . once players have secured access to itc at a given  price , they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the  capacity into structured deals . the result could be more aggressive  maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike , resulting in  greater competition at the national level .  * reducing the competitiveness of imports . the results of international  transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported  power into domestic markets . final prices offered for itc will reflect the  relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more  expensive to import .  * spurring investment in transmission . the money raised through auction could  provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in  upgrading international transmission links . access to international  transmission capacity between the netherlands , germany , and belgium in 2001  was auctioned for 63 million euros ( see http : / / www . tso - auction . org for  details ) . ? auctions for access into spain , france , and italy are expected to  realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets .  connecting rather than integrating markets  auctions between national grids , or more accurately commercial grids , are a  pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international  transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis . the auctions will  open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission  system operators .  even so , the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or  the stated objectives of european policymakers . in cera \\' s view the following  issues may eventually bring down the hammer on itc auctions :  * third - party transit . the bilateral nature of itc auctions perpetrates the  problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit  through a third grid . this is ultimately inconsistent with the european  commission \\' s objective of a single european power market . the fact that  physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always  transit third - party grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach .  * transaction - based scheme . although still transactional in nature ( tied to a  specific deal ) , auctions fall within the european commission \\' s stated  preference for market - based mechanisms for allocating international  transmission capacity . it remains to be seen how successful this approach is  in achieving integration of national markets . action at the european level  could move allocation of itc in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms  such as market splitting , counter trading , or redispatching .  * gaming of auctions . auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission  on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most . in practice  it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided . even though most of the  auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity , tactical  maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price  of imported power .  * allocating auction proceeds . one likely outcome of auctions will be the  transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the  rents currently reaped by other players . this will works to raise the value  of transmission assets relative to generation , suppliers , or traders . it  remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among  transmission companies and the grid , as transmission is still currently  subject to monopoly regulation .  * * end * *  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , \" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future \" in houston , february 12 -

( datedbrentcrude - 18 . 8 ) + constant ,  where n is 14 , 15 or 16  [ reddish curves ]  r - squared approx 0 . 49  f - stat approx 32  the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this  equation , and also the three best relations from before which were based upon  current and future rpi :  pllu ( t ) = a . rpi ( t ) + b . rpi ( t + n ) + constant , where n is 14 , 15 or 16  [ greenish curves ]  r - squared approx 0 . 47  f - stat approx 45  comparison of models  as you can see , the two equations differ in the very short - term and very  long - term ; the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to short - term  predictions of 3 . 0 % to 3 . 2 % over the next six months . the greenish curves  predict pllu in the range of 2 . 5 % to 2 . 8 % over the next six months .  the curves are then very similar until 2009 , when the models including crude  break - away to the upside , relative to the falling rpi curve . the model based  purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term . this  is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009  ( which we don \\' t ) .  suggestion  what could be useful now is a differently - specified model designed to  forecast only the next 3 months , using auto - regressive or auto - regressive  error terms . this model would be far more accurate in the near - term , and we  could include this information onto the front of this long - term model . this  may be useful , despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time  buckets .  back - testing  all the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data  sample used ( based mainly on 1990 s \" new paradigm \" economy ) .  hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele - conference ;  your ideas on this would be appreciated .  regards ,  anjam  x 35383',\n 'Subject: re : real options  hi navroz  having presented my real options work at a recent conference , i think i can  see my way clear to producing a much reduced version ( 3 or 4 pages ) of my  \" diagrammatic real options \" paper . would risk still be interested in such a  shortened article ?  cheers ,  steve  enron capital & trade resources corp .  from : \" navroz patel \"  05 / 23 / 2000 11 : 37 am  please respond to \" navroz patel \"  to :  cc :  subject : real options  steven ,  after further consultation with the technical editor , we feel that your work  would find a more suitable environment for exposure in the journal of risk .  ?  if you email a copy of your work ( to the editor - in - chief , philippe jorion )  and outline what has happened to :  ?  ? pjorion @ uci . edu  ?  then i am sure that they will be keen to give due consideration .  ?  thank you for your interest and sorry for the delay in coming to this  decision .  ?  best wishes ,  ?  navroz patel ,  technical assistant , risk magazine .  ?',\n 'Subject: 20 th annual ceraweek - \" shooting the rapids : strategies and risks  for the energy future \"  mr . vincent j . kaminski  managing director  enron capital & trade resources corp .  dear mr . kaminski :  i am pleased to invite you to join my cera colleagues and me at our 20 th  annual executive conference , \" shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for  the energy future \" to be held february 12 - 16 , 2001 in houston , texas . ? this  is the premier international gathering offering senior executives new ideas ,  insights and strategic thinking on the issues facing the global energy  industry .  i believe you will find the conference and related social events timely and  of considerable value . ? our focus will be on the critical implications of the  current market turmoil for energy strategies , investment , regulatory  backlash , competitive dynamics , and industry structure . ? presentations cover  all key regions and energy sectors - - oil , natural gas and power - - and their  interconnections . ? the conference is the centerpiece of ceraweek , a full week  of senior level meetings designed to foster exchange and learning , as well as  informal interaction and networking . ? last year \\' s participants included some  1600 executives from over 57 countries .  complete details on ceraweek 2001 can be found at ?  http : / / www . cera . com / cfm / track / mc . cfm ? p = 670 & c = 2804 ? . to register , please go  directly to http : / / www . cera . com / cfm / track / mc . cfm ? p = 781 email  register @ cera . com ; or call us at 1 ( 800 ) 879 - 2372 ext . 800 ( outside the u . s .

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,  asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron \\' s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining .  ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,  credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years .  on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me .  as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,  may 3 / 4 are good for me .  regards  nalin  at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote :  > hi ,  >  > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr .  > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some  > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options ,  > etc .  >  > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems .  >  > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about  > the following :  > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly  > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) .  >  > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect  > to telecoms , broadband , etc .  > * who you would like to meet with me - vince kaminski ( our  > boss ) , any other of our colleagues in research , broadband , etc .  > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc .  >  >  >  >  > look forward to hearing from you .  >  > regards ,  > iris',\n 'Subject: bogdan szopa - cv  vince :  can you give me some background on bogdan ?  many thanks . shawn  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by shawn cumberland / enron _ development on  02 / 12 / 2001 08 : 12 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  awenda 2000 @ cs . com on 02 / 11 / 2001 11 : 26 : 12 pm  to : shawn . cumberland @ enron . com  cc :  subject : bogdan szopa - cv  dear shawn ,  it was a pleasure talking to you today . i will call you upon my return from  europe . in the meantime we will stay in touch via e - mail .  enclosed is my curriculum vitae .  best regards ,  bogdan m . szopa  - bogdan res . . doc',\n 'Subject: henwood license  karla :  please inform henwood that enron will renew the license for the prosym  software modules but will not renew the licenses for north american databases .  the software modules to be renewed are :  base system ( prosym ? ) ( ecosym is included in the base system )  asap / mstat  multisym  emss interface .  it is not 100 % sure that the last module is required . nevertheless , please  begin the agreement amendment process asap . i will let you know if there are  modifications soon .  thanks ,  grant .',\n \"Subject: an invitation to advertise on freightmart !

i thought we should drop you a line and  give you an idea as to what \\' s been accomplished in the first week as well as  some of the challenges and problems we \\' ve run into . this way we can make the  most effective use of vince \\' s time .  1 ) current products and customers  in our first 3 days - we established 6 different customer groups -  representing approximately 40 traders plus additional fundamentals and  analytics folks . the groups are : uk trading , gas fundamentals , crude  trading , weather derivatives , continental power , and an internal trader  newsletter .  we \\' ve built the following framework to address these customers - the key  deadlines are noted :  0800 : uk trading / weather derivatives / fundamentals : prepare a 1 to 5 day uk  specific forecast and assess the 12 z runs of the ecmwf ( and ensembles ) , the  avn as well as earthsat \\' s 1 - 5 day outlook . the traders are particularly  interested in the performance of the ecmwf as it feeds all of their demand  models . we prepare a 1 page summary and give an idea as to any particular  forecast biases - whether we feel things may come in warmer or colder than  the model . we brief the traders and field questions then provide our report  to the fundamentals group .  * * in the future we would like to be able to gather raw data from the avn and  mrf to provide a series of choices which could be input into their demand  models or at least be able to give them our \" best pick \" of guidance and how  we feel things may deviate from that pick .  1030 am : obtain the uk met 6 - 10 and 1 - 5 day forecasts . provide comment for  uk trading .  1200 : uk trading / crude and products / weather derivatives : prepare a full  qualitative analysis of oz models ( mrf / nogaps / canadian / ensembles ) . produce a  6 to 10 day europe forecast and make any needed adjustments to the 1 to 5 day  forecast . produce the global weather report including a global executive  summary ; analysis of teleconnections and their expected impact ; 1 to 5 and 6  to 10 day forecasts compared to earthsat ; a 10 day city forecast table for  european cities along with the expected effect on heating demand and finally  a \" port status report \" describing weather and port conditions in 11 worldwide  ports . update traders ( uk and wx deriv ) on changes or new trends in the oz  models . provide a quality assessment of the uk met 6 to 10 and 1 to 5 day  forecast for uk trading .  1330 ( mon - wed ) : brief the crude and products groups in london and houston .  1600 : review 12 z avn for any major forecast changes and communicate changes  to traders .  weekly : produce a weather article for \" critical mass \" - internal trading  newsletter .  of course between 1000 and 1330 we are looking closely at the us weather for  support to you guys in houston . i \\' m still writing the daily us executive  summary as well as producing a 6 to 10 day us forecast .  2 ) requested projects :  * gas fundamentals has asked us to provide weather information for their  morning report and website . they would like to be able to gather objective  output from as many forecast models as we can get .  * weather derivatives has asked for week ahead , month ahead , and seasonal  outlooks for temperature and precipitation . they have also asked about  creating a tradeable \" nao index \" and developing an in - house model for  forecasting nao .  * continental power has asked for temperature and precipitation outlooks for  power generation and hydro .  * gas fundamentals , uk trading , continental power , weather derivatives and  crude and products have all asked for a european summer outlook for  temperature and precipitation . we expect to have this completed tomorrow .  * the research group has asked for assistance in gathering climate data  across spain for temperature and precipitation .  3 ) leads to follow up on :  * elsa in houston asked us to contact some of the softs traders here and let  them know once we were up and running .  * contact chris mahoney to determine if we can provide and additional support  for crude and products .  * follow up on a potential morning breifing for continental power  4 ) challenges :  * we \\' ve been told that we will be moving locations next week - which might  entail corrupting or loosing the software and hardware configurations that  have taken almost a week to get fully established . it seems that this office  functions on a \" hot desk \" system where people are constantly moving around .  this will make it very difficult to stay connected - as well as very  difficult for our customers to identify us .  * administrative detail take an inordinate amount of time . assembling  reports both physical and electronic can take nearly as long as actually  preparing the reports !  - - -  mike ,  ok - i think that brings you up to speed . i \\' ve been amazed at the amount of  feedback we \\' ve already gotten and we \\' ve only been here 3 days ! on that note  i wanted to let you know that i am fully committed to this project . it seems  that we will not have a second meteorologist to assist tony by my planned  departure date on the 20 th . as such - i can continue in my current role  through my planned vacation - keeping me in london until the 27 th - which is  my current reservation back to houston . i am also open to remaining in  london beyond the 27 th to ensure the success of this project .  hopefully this gives you a good idea as to what \\' s gone on in the first few  days here . we look forward to talking to you later today and with you and  vince tomorrow .',\n 'Subject: re : p + spread options  jeff ,  a short follow up on the p + options .  attached is a chart showing historical correlations for calendar spreads  between futures contracts . it shows correlation over four different time  horizons up to the roll of the nearest contract in each pair . as you can  see the level is usually higher than 0 . 98 and often near 0 . 99 . if our  current book of \" index p + \" options were re -

- improving the efficiency of mailings and other  promotional campaigns ( so there is an efficiency angle , see ! )  because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on  actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than  demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and \" new  entrants \" i \\' ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have  some tests of our data underway , but we \\' re interested in talking to as many  players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet  utility needs .  i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but  i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to  arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron  might have interest in hearing what we \\' re up to , and ( most importantly )  listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets .  thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and  hearing how things are going for you .  regards ,  brad davids  303 -

no sun , cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the excitement in enron credit .  it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper / duffie report seems to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate ( in his forwarded email ) that this is not the priority at the moment .  in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on the current state of enron credit - \" a fish rots from the head . \"  finally , i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this duffie report : do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear - that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting \" infrastructure \" ? or do you want to hear what i really see , hear , read , etc . ? if the latter is true , then i may need to write two reports , because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the enron credit personnel too happy .  well , i think i have said enough for now . look forward to your feedback .  thanks ,  iris  -

- this is probably more important than preparing a document for duffie right now . you should definitely sit with ben / george and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used . but we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data . both amitava and i will help as best as we can , and answer any direct questions , but we will have limited time to review documents , etc . i expect amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming , but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data .  hope the trip is going well . would you be extending the trip for some more time ?  vasant',\n 'Subject: pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg \\' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific \\' soft \\' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to \\' predict \\' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to ,  which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating / score to price .  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model .  building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural  nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and  software packages to use ?  determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model .  getting the \" true \" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present  such a price exists for very few credits .  allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would  take 6 - 10 man - months to develop .  further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy  asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don \\' t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at \\' internet speed \\' .  regards  ben',\n \"Subject: enron metals  hi tanya  thanks for your time last week -

quantitative presentation out that outlines how enron  can take on the downside risk of local crop prices ( enron probably needs to  cover actual local prices and not simply an index because i do not think the  govt will want to worry about basis risk ) .  the pilot program itself will be very small , and lends itself to continuing  down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination .  another thought on hedging our potential short positon ( on the origination  side ) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent  of the premium received -

10 to implement a  new price cap methodology .  the new methodology will become effective 11 / 3 / 2000 or as soon thereafter as  can be implemented . caiso staff has indicated that it will be difficult to  achieve that start date . they have not yet indicated what an achievable date  might be .  the new price cap methodology will remain in place until :  comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven  to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions .  either ferc or the iso board orders its removal .  cap prices will be based on the average nymex l 3 d settlement average and the  following heat rate table :  load level heat rate 4 . 00 gas example cap  40 gw $ 250 / mwh $ 250 / mwh  caps will be rounded up to the nearest $ 5 / mwh increment .  demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps .  the iso will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior  to the beginning of each calendar month . based on the iso ' s two day - ahead  system load forecast , the iso will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior  to the hour of delivery .  ferc context  ferc has delegated cap authority to the caiso until 11 / 15 / 2000 .  the iso has asserted that they don ' t need ferc authority since it is a bid  cap rather than a sales cap . ferc regulates sales , not purchases , of  electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices .  the iso has filed with ferc for an extension of the price cap authority .  ferc has to rule on the filing by 11 / 18 / 2000 . ( note that this is 3 days  after their authority expires )  ferc will release its proposed order on 11 / 1 / 2000 based on the results of its  206 investigation of the california wholesale power markets . we don ' t know  what they will find or what they will propose .  the proposed order will have a 30 day comment period , after which ferc will  likely issue a final order . ferc will be accepting oral comments on  11 / 9 / 2000 in washington . enron still has to determine who will provide oral  comments .  many companies have filed at ferc advocating or opposing a litany of price  caps , cost based rates , and market redesign recommendations .  it is likely that the price caps approved by the iso board will go into  effect . how long they will remain in effect will depend on whether ferc  extends the iso price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from  the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy .  impact of price caps  the attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at  different gas price levels . we think that this is the highest that markets  would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap . it is hard to  say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap  because we don ' t know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the  cap . the assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below .  take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000 .  calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load , new  price cap methodology , and a range of gas prices .  divide historical hours into peak and off - peak buckets .  calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off - peak hours .  for example , we have two years worth of data for the months of january  through september . each month has approximately 400 hours . for january  through september , we took approximately 800 observations for each month ( 400  from each year ) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual  observations .  we created a peak table and an off - peak table . the table shows the  calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices  for each month . this value represents what the month would clear at if each  hour cleared at the cap ( based on historic loads ) . while any given hour  could be above this value , our calculation estimates the likely monthly  average cap value !  the blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current ( 10 / 27 / 2000  nymex ) forward prices . the yellow shading indicates those forward power  prices which are in excess of the proposed cap .\",\n 'Subject: re : invoice for energy derivatives courses  i already did -

( i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward . )  i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of  our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the  same  time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business .  if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest  you  begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar .  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar .  thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later .  thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting  that  i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don \\' t show  anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .  dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc .  27121 adonna ct .  los altos hills , ca 94022  ( 650 ) 218 - 3069  dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com  ( see attached file : license . doc )',\n \"Subject: presentation to faculty and students at berkeley  vince - -  please feel free to also call jeff dasovich ( 415 - 782 - 7822 ) in our san  fransisco office . he has been very involved in the california market  discussions and presented before ferc during their field hearings . he knows  the profs you are meeting with and has some great insights into our positions .  jeff also attended berkeley as an undergrad and is now attending their  b - school in the evenings .  thanks .  jim steffes  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by james d steffes / hou / ees on 09 / 20 / 2000  09 : 33 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  from : steven j kean @ enron on 09 / 20 / 2000 09 : 21 am  sent by : steven j kean @ enron  to : maureen mcvicker / na / enron @ enron , james d steffes / hou / ees @ ees , elizabeth  linnell / na / enron @ enron  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  subject : presentation to faculty and students at berkeley  maureen - - please send vince my california testimony and the talking point  presentation for jeff skilling at the national press club .  eliz - - keep vince on the distribution list for the documents we are  generating now to repond to the california situation .  - - - - - forwarded by steven j kean / na / enron on 09 / 20 / 2000 09 : 18 am - - - - -  vince j kaminski @ ect  09 / 18 / 2000 01 : 26 pm  to : steven j kean / na / enron @ enron  cc : charlene jackson / corp / enron @ enron , celeste roberts / hou / ect @ ect , vince j  kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , ashley baxter / corp / enron @ enron  subject : presentation to faculty and students at berkeley  steve ,  i am a lead recruiter at the university of california at berkeley for  enron analyst / associate program .  i contacted several friends who work at berkeley and received an invitation  from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly faculty seminar  of the dept . of industrial engineering and operations research .  the students and faculty members from the business school will be also  invited .  berkeley in general , and department of industrial engineering and operations  research in  particular , are important centers of academic research on electricity markets  ( s . oren works very closely with severin borenstein ) .  my presentation will focus on the analyst / associate program . i shall also  have  an opportunity to discuss the power markets in california ( i expect many  questions ) before many experts who are very important to shaping  public opinion and regulatory agenda .  please , let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this  presentation  and in presenting enron ' s point of view in a more effective way .  vince  fyi . the name of my friend who invited me :  shmuel s . oren , professor  dept . of industrial engineering  and operations research  4117 etcheverry hall  university of california  berkeley , ca 94720 - 1777\",\n 'Subject: re : calpx power prices  ?

76 model assumptions  extended to two commodities ) .  the payoff for a call option is :  payoff = max ( 0 , a \\x01 ) b \\x01 ) k ) .  where :  a = nxwti ( delivery price for nymex )  b = posting price = ( wti swap ) \\x01 ) ( posting basis )  k = posting bonus ( fixed ) .  the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options  is that leg \" b \" of the spread is a combination of three prices , the two  futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month , and the  average posting basis during the delivery month . combination of these  prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg \" b \" and  the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of  prices and its correlation with the nxwti price . i believe that this  approach is more straightforward than the alternative , which would be to use  a three or four - commodity model with its associated volatility and  correlation matrices .  in summary , i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of  these types of options , assuming that the inputs are set correctly .  regards ,  stinson gibner  v . p . research',\n 'Subject: enron tiger team  dear jeff ,  our tiger team very much enjoyed your presentation about enron global markets  on friday . given that we have latitude in our project scope , our team would  like to assist enron in evaluating a new market opportunity . you mentioned  several markets that enron is considering in 2001 , including transportation ,  cement , coffee , cocoa , sugar , etc . we believe that a project of this sort  will give us the opportunity to really learn how enron creates value , what  its business model and core competencies are , and how they can be translated  to a new market . furthermore , we can get an in -

( i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward . )  i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same  time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business .  if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you  begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar .  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar .  thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later .  thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that  i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show  anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .  dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc .  27121 adonna ct .  los altos hills , ca 94022  ( 650 ) 218 -

operation to enable us achieve our goal , and not a  perfidious person . on the 6 th of may , 2002 it was reported to us that my  client , his wife and their only daughter were involved in a local plane  crash at kano state , enroot abuja ( the capital city ) all occupants in the  plane lost their lives , unfortunately on this same flight were other  dignitaries like the sports minister and a host of others  meanwhile , until his death , my late client had a fixed deposit account of  usd $ 15 . million deposited in a security company ( unic security company )  here . recently , i received an ultimatum from the security company asking me  to provide my late client ' s relative so that the money would be given to  them . but unfortunately it was discovered that my late client did not  declare any identifiable family member in all the official documents he  tendered to the security company while opening the account .  therefore , this development leaves me as the only person with the full  picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit my  late client made and who is entitled to be the bona fide beneficiary / next of  kin or relative because he died intestate . therefore , if i fail to locate  any of his relatives or his next of kin ( and have this money transferred to  them ) the security company will at the expiration of the 6 weeks ultimatum  given to me confiscate the account .  according to the ultimatum issued to me by the security company , if i fail  to present to them my late client ' s relative , with a legitimate statement of  claim for the money before the given time they will confiscate the account  and the money declared ' unclaimed balance ' . this will result in the money  being taken over by the security company . this will not happen if i have my  way .  since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives of my late client  all these while , my proposal , therefore , is to present you as the next of  kin / relative of my client due to the fact that you are a foreigner and can  easily pass as a possible relative of my client . i know you will be  wondering how possible this could be but i assure you that this is simple .  i therefore seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my client  so that the money he deposited with the security company would be paid to  you and there after you and i will share the money 40 % for you and i will be  taking 60 % . i assure you that the deposit would be released to you within a  few days because i have all the relevant information that would facilitate  that will be required on documentation .  first , i will like you to provide immediately the following information :  your full names .  contact address .  telephone / fax numbers .  with this information i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavit  that will put you in place as the next of kin . after we have successfully  satisfied the requirements of the bank the money totaling usd 15 . million  would be paid into your account for you to take 40 % and i will be taking  60 % . all i require is your honest co - operation to enable us see this  through .  there is no risk at all because everything would be done legally and my  position as a qualified attorney will facilitate everything . secondly , i  will give you all the necessary documents that would serve as evidence  proving that you are the next of kin / relative of my late client . these  documents will legally conferm on you the status to act as the beneficiary  of the estate of my late client .  what i related to you might smack of unethical practice but i want you to  understand that this is a once in life time opportunity capable of turning  around our situation . the truth is that this money would not be taken by the  government but by some greedy security company officials and i would not  fold my arms and watch this happen hence my decision to contact you .  if you are interested in doing this transaction with me kindly send your  reply to this email address : ( arismanshonikon @ shymail . com )  thank you as i await your positive response .  barr . arisman shonikon .\",\n 'Subject: performance  at this point , monday december 4 th seems to be free for most of you  whose calendar i have .  let me know .  thanks !  shirley  -

- much of it has never been captured . many departments are keeping  records well beyond their legal retention requirements , taking up valuable  and expensive office space . the fileplan , once completed , will document what  is being created , who has responsibility for it , and how long it must be  maintained .  during our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic  records . we ' ll also try to identify any computer systems your area ( s ) use .  the inventory itself is non - invasive , in that we do not open or look into  file cabinets or desk drawers . it ' s simply an interview process where the  contact answers a few easy , simple questions .  please feel free to contact me if you have any questions . thank you .  sara bolken  x 35150\",\n 'Subject: option pricing discrepancy for j . c . penny transaction  amitava and seksan have identified the source of the discrepancy between the  option prices calculated by the credit - reserve model and the stand - alone  spreadsheet model used in deal pricing . the discrepancy can be traced to  differences in input variables of the two models and not to any algorithmic  differences .  the options being priced are a strip of options on monthly instruments . the  credit reserve simulation program calculates the time to expiration by  assuming that the option expires on first day of the contract month of the  underlying contract , which is a very reasonable assumption .  the stand - alone option pricing spreadsheet allows specification of the option  expiration date independent of the contract month of the underlying . in the  jc penney transaction , the monthly options were assumed to expire in the  middle of the contract month , when in reality the underlying monthly  contracts expire before the start of their respective contract months . the  stand - alone spreadsheet model allows such specifications and it is up to the  user to ascertain that the expiration dates entered are legal . at present ,  seksan is ascertaining that the option contracts involved are in deed monthly  options and not a strip of daily options , in which case we would require  estimates of intramonth volatilities for both the spreadsheet model and the  credit reserve model .  regards ,  rabi de',\n \"Subject: re : charles shen  thanks so much , vince -

hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have  information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with  riskcalc .  we have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from  our colleagues in the london office .  we need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us  with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties .  more specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following  financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties :  fiscal year  the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements  are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables ,  such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be  a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or  2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation  is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in  general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size  affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000  makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) .  cash & equivalents  this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities .  inventory  inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars ,  without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average  cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and  supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would  include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs ,  insurance costs , and storage costs .  current assets  this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables ,  marketable securities , and other current assets .  total assets  total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars .  for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total  assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment  plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items ,  and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for  australian companies .  current liabilities  liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are  short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities .  total liabilities  this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number  representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other  noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and  minority interest ) .  retained earnings  retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative  earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders .  typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less  distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low  credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank  for australian companies .  sales  this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of  actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period )  reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances  for which credit is given to customers .  cost of goods sold  entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number  less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to  production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or  items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative  expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies .  ebit  earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it  can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income .  interest expense  this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short -  and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the  prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of  computing this is : interest expense = 0 . 07 * total liabilities .  net income  this item represents the income ( or loss ) reported by a company after  expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the  fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations . a  loss is represented by a negative sign . for example , a $ 5 , 000 , 000 loss would  be entered as -

hoc var ? ) that can be delivered to the \" official books  and records \" on a daily basis . this i believe would be acceptable for a 2 - 3  month time frame ( at which time we get versionlb ) as opposed to waiting 2 - 3  months to implement a better process and have nothing in the interim .  ultimately , i would look for version 2 a to be delivered and very defendable  by 1 / 1 / 01 . this will require indulgence and compromise on all fronts but i  cannot conceive of a better way . please let me know if this is consistent  with your understanding . a critical point from my perspective is that the mg  commercial team and metal operations staff understand their role in making  this happen and willingness to accept the consequences . i look for you to  take the lead as leader of the integration to do so . if you need any input  from the rest of us to underscore the importance please let us know . as i  alluded to on the phone , the people in houston that have been involved in the  var process have been through an extraordinary period of detailed scrutiny of  var by commercial and have been hindered by the lack of basic understanding  by all parties as their responsibilities . given the distance and the newness  of the metals personell , i fear that this could set us all up for some  surprises and some very uncomfortable communication , much of which is not  entirely necessary .  thanks  ted  eric gadd  07 / 21 / 2000 11 : 46 am  to : ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , bjorn hagelmann / hou / ect @ ect  cc : richard sage / lon / ect @ ect  subject : attached fax  ted and bjorn -

she is now widely relied on  by gas , power , crude and equity marketers , as well as traders from the  calgary office . in addition , she developed and presented seminars to bring  traders up to speed on techniques in technical analysis .  also this last year patricia built and populates daily the research group ' s  intranet site on technical analysis .  as a crowning achievement ( but just the beginning ) , patricia was given the  authority to actually trade natural gas as jeff shankman , managing director ,  authorized her book for technical analysis trading .  currently , we are proceeding with the expansion of her group personnel -

based platform for  transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the  site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell  at the posted price . this converts a \\x01 & bulletin board \\x01 8 ( the more typical  ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,  competitors that can provide this capability .  we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be  dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are  correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .  accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this  opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net  works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a  broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately  be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike  mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial  officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for  enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .  replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron  north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron \\x01 , s executive  committee .  global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net  works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as  an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology  officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the  development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .  enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now  be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to  utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the  following individuals are included in enron net works along with their  current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay  fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,  pulp and paper .  over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational  design and will provide full details on this exciting new business  opportunity .',\n \"Subject: mit phone interview -

tolerant  storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their  employees , suppliers and customers .  but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements , on average ,  double every 12 months , while processor speeds double every 18 months ,  companies are left with a quandary : how can they manage the  proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for  the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds ?  the simple answer to this question is to institute a well - executed  storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in  advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support  those needs . bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not  from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those  systems .  there are several ways to efficiently manage storage . one of the best  routes is consolidation that is , pooling resources and managing  storage as a system , as opposed to a decentralized collection of file  servers . this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era , when  enterprise storage resided on mainframes . but it \\x01 , s actually a  progressive step , as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing  the planning , management , and ongoing support of storage systems than it  does with the physical location of the files .  next , it is important to recognize that not all information is equally  important to the organization . consequently , storage requirements vary  by business application . as in all areas of it , it is important to make  storage implementation decisions based on business needs .  businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for  alternatives to the distributed file server storage model . they want to  speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth - intensive backup and  recovery operations from the lan .  network - attached storage ( nas ) supplies it professionals with one  answer , giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to  stored data . nas devices , which have been widely available for years ,  are optimized to process i / o transactions . though they promise better  performance , they don \\x01 , t remove backups from the transport network .  instead , they supply a relatively easy - to - deploy solution to cross -  platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments .  many consider storage - area networks ( san ) to be the best long - term  answer to current and future storage challenges . because sans are  designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network , they  alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated  with more traditional storage models . yet , given the early deployment  stage most companies are still in , many of those capabilities are still  largely untested in a production environment .  this newsletter will examine how , through effective storage management ,  it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery  to their customers . this newsletter will not focus on items like the  least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library . instead , it will  look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging  technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues .  ultimately , the goal is to identify storage technology options and  practices that work in real -

mail , contrary to the standard  approaches , i model spikes directly , as self - reversing jumps on top of a  stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of  spikes . in this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non - markovian  process , even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is  markovian . among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit  valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes , provided that  the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the  absence of spikes .',\n \"Subject: hrgovcic , hrvoje  please incease the bonus for hrgovcic in vince kaminski ' s research group for  a total of $ 75 , 000 . the difference of $ 47 , 500 should be charged to jeff  shankmans cost center . this request was prompted by jeff shankman and vince  kaminski .  norma villarreal  ews generalist  x 31545\",\n 'Subject: re : mid -

sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody .  we have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than  seventy - five percent  we have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva .  there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings :  statistics advantages  options  economics  we are looking for the followings :  01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . )  ( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ .  ( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces  ( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide  more than 2 billion us $ per day .  ( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day )  theadvantages of the technology developed by us :  a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially .  b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression .  by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all .  c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced .  as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be :  2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ .  d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further .  e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels .  3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion .  f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind .  g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind .  h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future .  i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also .  . among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options  available to us : -  a - outright sale  ( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration .  ( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in \" a \" .  the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price .  b - licencing options  i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis .  ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world .  c - combined options  a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement .  the economics of the project will be as follows : -  1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation .  2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle .  but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided .  3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective .  4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles .  5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from .  6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency .  7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ .  8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date .  9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years .  10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle .  11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing .  12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate .  p . s .  1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct .  2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .

trip time from the client to the server  > ( irrespective of how far away the client is from your measurement  > host ) , because of tcps three - way handshake for connection  > establishment ; when you see the opening syn , you wait for the client  > to ack the server \\' s syn ack and you have the client -

level response times ( i \\' d  > personally love to have a lot of data on the ratio of dns response  > time to tcp transfer time for http connections ) . even if the  > measurement makes no attempt to discern what constitutes a web  > transaction to the user ( a full page , usually many tcp connections ) .  >  > anyway , i think there are some fairly interesting things we can  > measure with simple techniques , these are just some simple ones .  > there may be some interesting things we could do by digging into  > payloads of a few of the other highly -

continue to coordinate on us 6 - 10 day forecasts with houston  - continue monday / wednesday briefings for crude meetings  - provide met comment and support toward weekly / monthly / seasonal official  outlooks from the uk met for wxderiv ( team support from houston )  - design and develop forecast of met forecast ( try to beat their release  by at least 1 hour ) prior to each daily update ( like our bloomberg forecaster )  - identify any additional \" market - movers \" , anticipate and add value to  same  \" back - burner \"  - develop a method for providing probability distribution / confidence  graphics based on numerical forecast guidance and ensemble data  \" on the shelf \"  - daily briefings and products for uk gas  -

time offer , however , i must admit that i did not find  the terms very favorable . unlike a person who is permamently located in  houston , i would have the inconvenience and cost of commuting between austin  and houston , and of accomodation both in austin and houston .  i really would love to work in the research group and am sincere about this .  i would just hope that you would consider compensating me at manager level  so that i can cover transportation , accomodation expenses and more  importantly , justify the decision to devote at least half of my time to  enron away from my thesis .  i will be looking forward to hearing from you soon .  best ,  cantekin dincerler  doctoral candidate  the university of texas at austin  graduate school of business  department of finance  office : ( 512 ) 471 -

the momentum continues - gdvi website debute  otc bbalert gdvi  news update : global diversified industries debutes brand new website !  www . gdvi . net  otc bb  alert  spectacular operating results momentum  continues  sales projections for next 12 months surpasses $ 20 million  99 . 8 %  revenue increase  278 % net  income increase  154 %  stockholders equity increase  79 %  increase in assets  $ 8  million order backlog  $ 50  million manufacturing capacity  overview  global diversified industries operates in the modular  building construction industry , and strategically targets the  california education sector . gdvi is strategically located in  central  california on 16 acres with a 100 , 000 square foot state - of - the - art  manufacturing facility .  throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building  its infrastructure through acquisitions , development of a  state - of - the - art manufacturing facility , and by securing the  requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth .  through the combination of its new facility ( $ 50 million  capacity ) , the increased demand for portable buildings and the state  of  california \\' s bond approvals , gdvi has become well positioned to  become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the  west coast .  gdvi should benefit greatly from the $ 12 . 1 billion  school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by  california voters next month ( march ) . this presents , in our opinion  an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before  the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and  subsequently invests in those companies .  global diversified has taken numerous strategic  development steps throughout 2003 and 2004 , including generating  strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive  growth in 2005 . the company is led by a strong management team with  previous success in building companies into $ 50 million per annum  businesses .  in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue  projections , renewed its piggyback contract , received state  approvals on engineered product designs , started a new credit  facility and opened its new 100 , 000 square foot manufacturing  facility . the company will continue to seek new acquisition  candidates through its aggressive growth plan .  profile  gdvi is a holding company that currently  operates two wholly owned subsidiaries , mbs construction inc . , a  modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work  and renovation and global modular , inc . , a sales , marketing and  manufacturing of modular type structures .  its principal customer base is currently educational  ( public and private schools , universities , etc . ) , child - care and  municipality sectors . its product lines consist of a variety of  portable classroom designs , including both single - story and two -  story floor plans . global modular \\' s portable classroom structures  are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre - approved  building plans , commonly referred to as p . c . \\' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications  administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) .  global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing  educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback  clause . the state of  california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular  classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful  bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities  portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the  originating school district . this process saves school districts  valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids .  a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may  have access to future business for up to five years , depending on  the term of the piggyback contract .  the strategic focus on california schools  since 1998 ,  california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new  classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures .  there are five compelling reasons for this trend :  modular  classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks )  they cost  significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 )  they offer  greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings  they are easier  to finance  they provide  financing incentives  to cope with population growth , the state department of  education estimates that  california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the  next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms .  due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout  the california education sector , public and private schools are  expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their  additional classroom requirements over the next four years .  the california schools budget crisis  on  november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond  proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by  california  voters .  this bond measure passage does not include an approximate  $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school  districts throughout the state .  a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the  voters on the march 2004 .  these bond measures are about three times higher than the  record $ 9 . 2 billion bond  california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these  bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which  include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular  classroom construction and renovations .  money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and  private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at  community colleges and other institutions of higher learning  throughout  california .  gdvi business infrastructure  among global modular \\' s asset base is its integrated ,  state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes  equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are  specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular  structures .  gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking  to add to its workforce as demand increases .  operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square  foot operating structure .  wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets ,  designs and manufactures the buildings  wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles  installation and building renovation .  symbol otc . bb  gdvi  recent price 13 . 5 cents  management team  philip hamilton , ceo and president  mr . hamilton has an extensive and very successful  background in modular manufacturing . from 1996 to feb 2000 he served  as chairman and ceo of pacesetter industries inc . he built this  company from inception into one of  californias  largest manufacturers , producing and installing thousands of schools  and commercial buildings . under his leadership , pacesetter  industries moved into a 5 , 500 , 000 sq . ft . facility in atwater ,  california with branch sales offices throughout the state . the  company employed a staff of over 650 employees and had annual sales  of $ 50 , 000 , 000 .  adam de bard , vice president  mr . de bard has over 6 years of experience in the  manufacturing and business sectors . from 1997 to 2000 he served as  vice president and chief  information officer of pacesetter industries .  ronald kilpatrick , director of finance  mr . kilpatrick has 36 years experience in both domestic  and international development and management of major corporations .  he is a managing partner of pacific rim capital llc which provides  venture capital to projects in the  pacific rim .  recent headlines  global diversified industries , inc . commencing efforts to  increase its u . s . based investor and public relations visibility  pr newswire ( tue 5 : 00 am )  global diversified industries , inc . modular division secures new  order worth more than $ 3 million for immediate delivery  pr newswire ( thu , jun 9 )  wallst . net airing all -

mail : dr _ tomeke @ spinfinder . com  lagos - nigeria .  attn :  request for urgent business relationship .  it is with my profound dignity that i write you this  very important  and highly confidential letter . first , i must  solicit your strictest  confidentiality in this transaction . this is by  virtue of its nature  as being utterly confidential and \" top secret \" .  though i know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make any one  apprehensive and  worried , considering the fact that we have not met  each other before ,  but i am assuring you that all will be well at the  end of the day . we  have decided to contact you by email due to the  urgency of this  transaction , as we have been reliably informed that  it will take at  least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal  post to reach you ,  so we decided it is best using the e - mail , which is  quicker and also  to enable us meet up with the second quater payment  for the year  2000 .  however , let me start by introducing myself properly  to you . i  am dr . tom eke , a director general in the department  of petroleum  resources ( d . p . r ) and i presently head the contract  award panel incharge  of contract awards and payment approvals . i came to  know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to  handle a very confidential business transaction  which involves the  transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account  requiring  maximum confidence . i and my colleagues are top  officials of the  federal government contract award panel . our duties  include evaluation , vetting , approval for payment of  contract jobs  done for the d . p . r e . t . c . in order to commence this  business we  solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer  into your account  the said funds . the source of this funds is as  follows : in the second  quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to  review and award  contracts to the tune of us $ 400 million us dollars  to a group of five  firms for the supply construction and installation  of oil pipe lines  in warri and port harcourt . during this process my  colleagues and i  decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately  over - inflate the  total contract sum from us $ 400 million to us $ 431  million united  states dollars with the main intention of sharing  the remaining sum  of us $ 31 miilion amongst ourselves .  the federal government of nigeria has since the  second quater of  year 2001 approved the sum of us $ 431 million for us  as the contract sum ,  and the sum of us $ 400 million has also been paid to  the foreign companies  concerned as contract entitlements for the various  contracts done , but  since the companies are entiltled to us $ 400 million  dollars only , we are  now left with us $ 31 million dollars balance in the  account which we intend to  disburse amongst ourselves , but by virtue of our  positions as civil  servants and members of this panel , we cannot do  this by ourselves ,  as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau  ( civil service  laws ) from opening and / or operating foreign accounts  in our names  while still in government service , making it  impossible for us to  acquire the money in our names right now . i have  therefore , been  delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my  colleagues in the  panel to look for an overseas partner into whose  account we would  transfer the sum of us $ 31 million . hence we are  writing you this  letter . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you  or your company  can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our  behalf , you or your  company will retain 20 % of the total amount ( us $ 31  million ) , while  70 % will be for us ( officials ) and the remaining 10 %  will be used in  offsetting all debts / expenses and taxes incurred  both local and  foreign in the cause of this transfer . needless to  say , the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in  return we demand your  complete honesty and trust .  you must however note that this transaction will be  strictly based  on the following terms and conditions as we have  stated below ;  a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and  diligence  b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost  secrecy and confidentiality  c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to  sit on the funds once it is under  your custody , or any form of blackmail .  d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release  the funds as instructed  by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from  the total amount .  please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and  risk free and we hope to conclude  this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days  from the date  of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .  we are looking  forward to doing business with you and solicit your  total confidentiality  in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i  give you my word that you  are completely safe in doing business with us .  transactions like this  have been successfully carried out in the past by  most government  executives . here in my country there is great  economic and political  disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant  and the order of  the day , thus explaining why you might have heard  stories of how  money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because  everyone is  making desperate attempts to secure his or her  future , so that when  we retire from active service we donot languish in  poverty . i will  explain more to you when i have heard from you .  please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using  the above e - mail address .  i will bring you into the complete picture of this  pending business  transaction when i have heard from you and also  receive your  confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me  fax to you all  necessary information you need to know about our  pending business  transaction . i will also send to you my private  telephone and fax  numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent  response will be  highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds  under the second  quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless .  yours faithfully ,  dr . tom eke .  n . b . please be informed that this business  transaction is 100 % legal  and completely free from drug money or money  laundering . this is a  complete legitimate business transaction .  -

related positions  in one place and  to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is  meeting to close a few  remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 .  a few comments on the book design and my view of the project :  a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island  facility  by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent  supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term  contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions .  the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long - term  contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are  setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos  but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and  coordinating  the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words ,  we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction .  b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension  option of  5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we  have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for  such a long tenor . this is  essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread  and  i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread .  one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the  first  5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side .  c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions  regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a  big prudence reserve  in case we mark it to market .  d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island  deal  ( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions .  long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail  that  correlates very well with brent .  vince  john sherriff  05 / 14 / 2000 01 : 40 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : lauren urquhart / lon / ect @ ect  subject : lng may 19 decision  vince  i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well .  anyway with greg moving to his  new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the  eastern hemishere plus lng .  i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for  lng and lng ship values . i also understand  that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far  away ) . anway i understand this  is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you  please let me know where you stand now ?  i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in  the next couple of days and if you  have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well .  look forward to connecting with you vince .  john\",\n 'Subject: hedge effectiveness test for fair value hedges  gentlemen :  we have had favorable responses regarding the use of our volatility  reduction method ( roger , i \\' ve attached a copy of our article in case you  hadn \\' t seen it ) . however , there continued to be a quibble about how to  create the set of data points that would be inputs into the testing process .  last week the consulting arm of a \" big five \" accounting firm indicated that  the following method proposed by us would be acceptable . we believe this  method overcomes the statistical problems that arise from using interest  rate differences from overlapping ( \" rolling \" ) quarters .  method :  1 ) calculate daily yield curve changes expressed as ratios , using historical  rates from the most recent , say , two years . ( note : no overlap ) . this  results in a set of around 494 vectors of ratios ( approximately 247 trading  days per  year ) .  example :  if the first three yield curves in the historical set look like this :  19980801 6 . 5 6 . 6 6 . 7 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 2  19980802 6 . 3 6 . 3 6 . 6 . . . . . . . . . 6 . 9  19980803 6 . 6 6 . 8 6 . 9 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 1  then the change from 8 / 1 / 98 to 8 / 2 / 98 is :  6 . 3 / 6 . 5 6 . 3 / 6 . 6 6 . 6 / 6 . 7 . . . . . . . . . . 6 . 9 / 7 . 1  and the change from 8 / 2 / 98 to 8 / 3 / 98 is :  6 . 6 / 6 . 3 6 . 8 / 6 . 3 6 . 9 / 6 . 6 . . . . . . . . . 7 . 1 / 6 . 9  2 ) randomly select 62 of these \" ratio \" vectors ( approx . 62 trading days in a  quarter ) .  3 ) multiply these ratio vectors together to get a single vector ( ie , the 62  6 mo ratios are multiplied together , the 62 lyr ratios are multiplied  togeter , etc . ) . the result represents a single quarterly yield curve  transformation . apply it to \" today \\' s \" yield curve . the resulting yield  curve represents one simulated quarterly change in interest rates  4 ) repeat steps 2 and 3 until an adequate number of yield curves are  generated , say 100 .  5 ) proceed with testing process .  i would be interested in your comments .  leslie abreo  andrew kalotay associates , inc .  61 broadway , ste 3025  new york ny 10006  phone : ( 212 ) 482 0900  fax : ( 212 ) 482 0529  email : leslie . abreo @ kalotay . com  visit aka \\' s website at http : / / www . kalotay . com  - fasl 33 article . pdf',\n \"Subject: re : lsu seminar visit  vince ,  please send a package of article reprints to the attention of joan payne at  the following address :  joan payne  department of finance  e . j . ourso college of business administration  louisiana state university  2163 ceba  baton rouge , la 70803  in your package , please indicate which presentation each reprint is  intended for ; i . e . , whether it is for student consumption on thursday  afternoon or finance faculty / doctoral student consumption on friday  morning . joan can make sure that we get the right number of copies  produced for the respective audiences .  concerning powerpoints - - just email these files to me and if it is all  right with you i will make them available for download by the faculty and  students on the class and research seminar webpages .  thanks again for being willing to visit lsu and present your knowledge to  our faculty and students .  sincerely ,  jim garven  at 01 : 39 pm 1 / 18 / 2000 + 0000 , you wrote :  > jim ,  >  > i can send you copies of the reprints of some papers i wrote  > or co - authored . please , let me know how many copies do you need .  >  > i shall prepare power point presentations for the student meeting  > and for the faculty meeting .  >  > for the students : review of my group ( things we work on ) with an intention  > of generating some interest among the students and soliciting resumes .  >  > for the faculty meeting : challenges that energy markets pose to financial  > modeling .  > i shall be able to e - mail the power point presentations later this month .  >  > vince  >  >  >  >  >  > jim garven on 01 / 17 / 2000 04 : 00 : 25 pm  >  > to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  > cc :  > subject : re : lsu seminar visit  >  >  >  > dear vince ,  >  > would you mind emailing to me a short biography / vita sometime when you get  > a chance ?

 here \\' s the story .  research forwarded to their personnel a solicitation they received for java  training by an outside person , weeklong classes for true beginners and for  those with decent programming experience in other languages ( esp c + + ) . vince  had pre - agreed tlo pay for it for anyone who wanted it . but , the response  they got was so \" overwhelming \" they reconsidered , for financial reasons , and  decided it would be better to just hire a professor to teach a class for a  week here . the costs would be around $ 15 , 000 , and there should be room for  around 15 people in the class . they have 6 - 8 people , and wonder if we might  have some people who would want to do it ( a no - brainer - java is a big - time  resume pad these days ) and would be willing to share the costs with them .  what is your opinion on this ? personally , i think it \\' s a relatively  inexpensive investment in our people , although , selfishly , it does increase  their \\' market value \\' so to speak .

 i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered  from the long flight back .  i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my  intentions here at enron .  software ( in compiled c on the unix platform ) has been developed and debugged  to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in  addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on  a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a  dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how  the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit  purposes .  these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for  which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines  elucidating the structure of the data .  i am in the process of documenting all of this for you .  with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has  agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if  the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been  researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine  will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be  able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is  compaq - specific .  i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you .  i \\' ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not  only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the  other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there  wasn \\' t enough free space on the server \\' s hard drive for the workfiles . in  discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power  trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were  ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc \\' s to my new one , and they  have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also ,  there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses ;  during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to  how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time  data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with \" well , we  have it , but we haven \\' t really tested it yet . \" an example is the weather : we  still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes  satellite .  my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only  if enron does well . these aren \\' t empty words - my ira is 100 % invested in the  enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the  areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the  research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people  at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren \\' t  directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren \\' t really their customers ,  except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses .  as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting  person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to  george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are  interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their  traders \\' access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with  kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were  disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they  also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid  on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron ; we all  work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but  merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years  as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a  state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me  they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful ,  including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to  teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i  have learned here .  so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be  a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you  in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol  database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their  documentation .  as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday ,  and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by  email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data  warehouse for floor trader support .  clayton .',\n \"Subject: re : bollerslev seminar  excellent . thank you .  bbo  at 03 : 19 pm 10 / 10 / 00 -

based technologies , we believe the company should change  its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategically  sourcing these requirements on a global basis . we believe that there are  significant cash savings to be extracted by the company and also commercial  potential for the formation of a highly profitable , business - to - business  e - commerce venture .  effective february 1 , 2000 , enron will form a new global strategic sourcing  unit . this new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic  sourcing initiatives underway in the gas pipeline group , global asset  operations and enron corp . initially , global strategic sourcing will focus  on aggregating enron \\x01 , s internal , joint venture and business partner demand  for products and services with the objective of creating a future  business -

groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering :  a ) pulp and paper \\x01 ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage  activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for  the provision of innovative  products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision  of paper risk management products ;  b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products \\x01 ) we have asked jim ajello to  lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be  responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the  chemicals and refined products industries ;  c ) non - integrated industrials \\x01 ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers  trust \\x01 , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the  coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the  provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,  heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles  and glass manufacturing industries .  midstream coverage / origination  a ) eastern coverage / origination \\x01 ) this group \\x01 , activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern  interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this  group ;  b ) western coverage / origination \\x01 ) this group \\x01 , s activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they  will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring  opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the  leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from  calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;  c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination \\x01 ) this group \\x01 , s activities will focus on  the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the  emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio \\x01 , s of merchant  power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked  mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will  continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern  interconnect ;  d ) eastern qf restructuring \\x01 ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring  opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing  restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have  asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,  formerly of enron asia \\x01 , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of  citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join  this newly formed business .  2 ) commercial transactions :  the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff  donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of  transactions within ena \\x01 ) and thereby , improve ena \\x01 , s efficiency in executing  transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity  of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction  development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity  structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical  analysis and upstream asset management .  the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,  execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction  with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of  which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this  dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service  and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg  resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to  the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :  a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and  western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group  include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy  lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of  capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today  from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power  origination .  b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena \\x01 , s industrial  origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,  environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is  established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay  boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing  two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .  c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant  services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior  members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and  john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the  vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we  anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few  weeks .  d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer  finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include  brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition  of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .  ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and  downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary  responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will  continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior  commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual  responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the  capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain  largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction  development teams and their respective origination groups will be located  together .  we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage  and industry knowledge in all ena \\x01 , s markets particularly in the industrial  markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between  the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .  please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north  america by working with us to implement these changes .',\n 'Subject: meeting with dale nesbitt -

end screen graphs in order to interpret the  numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and  system \\' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each  station \\' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though ,  marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea  marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations  according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station  detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows :  for each hour , for each generating station :  \" marginal cost \" [ o / mwh ] = ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] -  vom _ cost [ o / mwh ]  this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a marginal  station which i get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a  station given in marginal station field in transarea marginal units query . i  have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and transarea _ data table but non  of the costs there match my results .  do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which  outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ?  it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case  could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling  understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much .  regards  karolina',\n \"Subject: softs in london  vince ,  with regard to the softs curves development , i have been communicating with a  couple of folks in london . the key contacts include james willis ( cocoa and  sugar broker ) and nigel majury ( coffee broker ) . we had a conference call on  thursday ( heather , trena , erin , james , nigel , frank speight , nelson ) to  discuss data sources , data acquisition , priorities , and timelines . a number  of data sources were identified ( e . g . , usda , int ' l cocoa organization , ed however , cocoa  replaces coffee in the softs importance hierarchy . i suppose that this  results from our physical ( or soon to be ) positions in both markets . the  timeline hasn ' t changed ; however , adjustments will have to be made since we  haven ' t yet acquired all of the necessary data for price modeling . moreover ,  per our discussion this afternoon , additional thought / time will have to be  devoted to corn modeling to come up with an adequate hedging strategy .  nelson\",\n 'Subject: re : nikkei and pko  -

- from a small power plant humming among the  birches near the ukrainian border , enron corp . has staked its claim on  the polish energy market .  yet after six years , the company is still seeking a mother lode .  the houston - based energy producer and trader entered poland in 1994 ,  nabbed one of the first power - trading licenses to go to a foreign  company and began work on elektrocieplownie nowa sarzyna , poland \\' s first  new , foreign - operated heat - and - power plant .  other companies followed , including electricite de france , rwe ag of  germany , vattenfall ab of sweden and tractebel sa of belgium .  the prize could be a rich one . all of these companies hope to profit  as poland sells its state energy assets and frees prices before joining  the european union .  a wholesale power bourse is due to open in warsaw in july . and the  country \\' s transmission links to markets east and west could make poland  the power - trading hub of central europe .  but after six years in poland , enron has yet to earn a profit . net  income from nowa sarzyna , which is to begin commercial production later  this month , is at least five years away . power - trading operations might  generate profits next year , if the new bourse gets moving . but that is  \" one big question mark , \" says jarek astramowicz , enron poland \\' s  president .  indeed , despite its promise , poland \\' s energy sector remains a  sizzling tangle of aging plants , archaic market agreements and complex ,  shifting regulations .  enron , with $ 40 billion ( 41 . 69 billion euros ) in annual revenue , is  an innovator and an investment bellwether for its peers . but in a power  market as negatively charged as poland \\' s , the company also is an example  of how shaky market conditions can keep even the savviest competitors  offline .  \" these are very large operations and to some extent they can bear  some risks , \" says pawel kaminski , energy - sector operations officer at  the world bank in warsaw . \" but eventually they have to generate some  return . \"  enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the u . s . it  entered europe in 1989 , setting up in london as the u . k . \\' s energy sector  liberalized . it entered the nordic market in 1996 , and today is the nord  pool \\' s largest - volume trader .  enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permits  for a power plant , and a further 29 months for construction .  just four years after entering the u . k . , enron finished its  1 , 875 - megawatt teesside plant . teesside \\' s capacity and cost , at gbp 795  million ( 1 . 32 billion euros ) , are many times larger than nowa sarzyna \\' s .  yet teesside was completed in only two - thirds the time . the company  declines to compare development times in various countries .  \" i wouldn \\' t necessarily put poland into the same category as russia , \"  says philip davies , regulatory and government - affairs manager at enron  europe in london . \" but obviously , given poland \\' s ( planned economy ) past ,  it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process  and get to the starting point . \"  at nowa sarzyna , it took enron nearly twice the usual time to reach  the starting point , even though mr . astramowicz already knew the site ,  and the polish power industry \\' s rules .  the nowa sarzyna plant was mr . astramowicz \\' s brainchild , and he  burned out the engine in his first bmw as he traveled between warsaw and  the town to craft the deal . a freelance energy - sector entrepreneur  before joining enron , mr . astramowicz sold his interest in nowa sarzyna  to enron in 1998 .  enron has spent $ 132 million to build nowa sarzyna , a 116 - megawatt ,  gas - fired combined heat - and - power plant . quiet , clean and efficient , the  plant stands in stark contrast to most of poland \\' s belching , coal - fired  behemoths . when it starts up this month , it will sell its electricity to  the polish power grid , the country \\' s high - voltage network , under a  20 - year power - purchase agreement , or ppa , that enron won in 1997 . steam  output goes to organika , the chemical company next door , and helps heat  the town of nowa sarzyna .  the nowa sarzyna plant is more than 80 % financed by commercial - bank  loans for which the only collateral is the plant \\' s concluded contracts .  \" they were betting on their good name , \" says michael davies , a  partner with allen & overy , the warsaw law firm that advised enron  poland \\' s lenders . \" they are pushing envelopes all the time . \"  that is especially true in a market with 30 % overcapacity , where an  energy law didn \\' t even exist until 1997 .  says peter bisztyga , emerging europe utilities analyst at solomon  smith barney in london : \" because enron signed a ppa , they are ok . . .  ( but ) i \\' m really not sure building nowa sarzyna was such a good idea . \"  mr . bisztyga says enron could have generated a faster return by  renovating an existing power plant . but , he acknowledges , nowa sarzyna  \" allowed enron to get into the polish market early and stamp their name  on it . \"  in 1994 , polish power plants weren \\' t for sale . energy asset  privatization , discussed for years , began in earnest only this year . by  2002 , the polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens of  power plants , 33 distribution companies and the polish power grid , a  12 , 000 - kilometer national transmission network of high - voltage lines .  the assets have a total book value of 33 billion zlotys ( 8 . 4 billion  euros ) , but murky regulations have driven prices down .  \" the regulations don \\' t promote competition and so you don \\' t really  know the price of electricity , \" says bengt wegemo , president of  vattenfall poland . earlier this year , vattenfall paid $ 235 million for  55 % in warsaw - based elektrocieplownie warszawskie , promising $ 340  million in investment in the heat - and - power plant over the next 10  years .  investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing .  ultimately , 170 licensed energy traders and 200 large power users will  trade on the bourse , setting the wholesale price of electricity . the  polish bourse will be modeled on its nordic counterpart . enron , the nord  pool \\' s largest trader , hopes to post polish trading profits by 2001 .  but first , say market experts , poland \\' s 1997 energy law must be  amended to ease functioning of the bourse , and free up access to  poland \\' s distribution network .  further , the government says it must solve the competition problem  posed by the polish power grid \\' s power - purchase agreements , which  account for 70 % of energy sales in poland . some state - owned plants used  the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing . when  prices are freed , these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete  with plants that didn \\' t spend money to modernize .  the government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the  modernized plants for their extra costs . though nowa sarzyna is a  private plant , the price enron must charge for its power is about twice  what outmoded plants charge .  \" we are hoping that continuous , efficient operation of the plant will  generate us a ( bigger ) profit , \" mr . astramowicz says .  another problem is cross - border power trading , where contradictory  legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the polish power grid , also  known as pse . enron and others protest that pse shouldn \\' t compete with  electricity - market participants who contract with it for transmission  service .  pse intends to stay in the trading business , says marek zerka , pse \\' s  vice president . in late march , pse and local company kulczyk holding  signed an agreement with preussenelektra ag of germany to export  electricity and coal to eu countries via germany .  \" this is great news , \" mr . astramowicz says . \" if this joint venture  gets access to pse \\' s cross - border transmission capacity . . . i would  expect pse to confirm open access to all market participants . \"  enron and others are pushing hard for that access . \" as soon as the  market becomes open , free and non - discriminatory , we will come out at a  decent profit , \" mr . astramowicz says .  folder name : enron in europe  relevance score on scale of 100 : 78  to review or revise your folder , visit http : / / www . djinteractive . com or  contact dow jones customer service by e - mail at custom . news @ bis . dowjones . com  or by phone at 800 - 369 - 7466 .

- -  1 ) how to price a single name ?  1 . 1 ) how to price a liquid single name ?  1 . 2 ) how to price an illiquid single name ?  2 ) how to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names ?  the approach i would take for 1 . 1 is  a ) define a small set of liquid names  b ) apply each of the different models we have , say , the six models ben has  mentioned below , to these names  c ) include market prices , if any , for these names  d ) sit with traders , get trader \\' s intuition on where each liquid name should  price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b ) and ( c )  e ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion  of the trader prices across the models  f ) quantify these attributes , if possible  g ) try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process , and see if the  decisions in the last round still make sense  the approach for 1 . 2 may be  a ) define a small set of illiquid names  b ) apply each of the different models we have to these names  c ) sit with traders , get trader \\' s intuition on where each illiquid name  should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b )  d ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion  of the trader prices across the models  e ) check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names  f ) define a master set of liquid names  g ) look for relationships ( by analyzing cross - section of data ) between  attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names  once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names  and their attributes , then this mapping can be entered into a table , and the  pricing can be automated for all names ( in theory ) ! the success will depend  on the success of the round - table sessions for the approaches for 1 . 1 and  1 . 2 .  building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task , but we can get  going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any  new models that we may build . new models can be added to the suite of  existing models . i do not believe there will ever be a single model that will  answer all questions for all names , but rather we can refine the mappings and  relative choices among models over time , which would mean continuing  round - table sessions with traders . limited data makes calibration very hard ,  so i would continually ask the question \" what do we calibrate ? \" throughout  the discussions for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 , and this may help guide us to new models .  vasant  benjamin parsons  06 / 19 / 2000 04 : 11 am  to : ect london credit trading  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , amitava  dhar / corp / enron @ enron , steven leppard / lon / ect @ ect , grant masson / hou / ect @ ect ,  dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , jitendra j  patel / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect  subject : pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg \\' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific \\' soft \\' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to \\' predict \\' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to ,  which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating / score to price .  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model .  building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural  nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and  software packages to use ?  determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model .  getting the \" true \" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present  such a price exists for very few credits .  allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would  take 6 - 10 man - months to develop .  further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy  asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don \\' t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at \\' internet speed \\' .  regards  ben',\n \"Subject: uregent ! important information about your website . . . .  hello ,  my name is steve scott and i ' m president and ceo of the worlds largest and most  profitable online internet affiliate program . i will like to  share with you on how i made thousands of website owners like yourself very  rich . yes , i mean filthy rich . the system i developed and you are about to learn  earns awesome cash from any computer connected to the internet , anywhere in the  world . in one month you can earned more than an entire years work !  making money doesn ' t get any easier than this ! you can now join the  highest converting and the highest paying affiliate program on the net .  get paid 75 % commission on the worlds most  wanted product . yes our product sells itself .  here are just a few  reasons to join our program :  -
